Please follow these steps to produce an ASCII grid level:

1. **Focus only on `LevelMapping`:**  
   - Read each symbol (e.g. `P`, `W`, `G`) and map it to its sprite type.  
   - Ignore all other details in `InteractionSet`, `TerminationSet`, and `SpriteSet` (aside from confirming which types appear in LevelMapping).

2. **Decide the grid size:**  
   - Output a rectangular grid (rows Ã— columns of your choice) that can accommodate at least one player and one goal.  
   - A common approach is to surround the perimeter with walls (`W`) and distribute some interior walls.

3. **Place the key elements (example):**  
   - **Player (`P`)**: exactly one.  
   - **Goal (`G`)**: exactly one.  
   - **Walls (`W`)**: any number, used to build boundaries and obstacles.  
   - **Empty spaces**: use `.` for all remaining cells.

4. **Output format:**  
   - Emit only the grid as lines of characters, all rows the same length.  
   - Do not include comments or extra explanatory text.

I want to create a game where the player must eliminate all butterflies while protecting the cocoons.
The player can move the avatar, avoid walls, and hunt butterflies.
When player collides with butterflies, butterflies will die.
Butterflies move randomly.
When butterflies collides with cocoons, cocoons will disappear. Then butterflies will be cloned.
